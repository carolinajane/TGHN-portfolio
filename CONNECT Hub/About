The files in this folder are for the CONNECT Hub, which is part of the OUCRU Research Group. 
In particular, this part of their group deals with a lot of the Vietnamese team memebrs and content.
The HTML code here are snippets of what I've sent to the hub content managers to help them with writing code themselves.
There is also coding for an event page I set up for a November 2023 webinar I assisted in organising and for which I designed the posters.
