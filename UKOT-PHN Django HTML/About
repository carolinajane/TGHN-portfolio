This folder contains HTML I wrote to publish content on the UKOT-PHN hub on TGHN.
The HTML is rather janky due to the restrictions placed on Django by the developers. 
This includes restrictions on creating any CSS changes embedded into the HTML as script.
Additionally, there isn't a lot of JavaScript accepted by the current Django set up for TGHN.
