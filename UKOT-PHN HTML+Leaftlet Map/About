This file is the first iteration of the map for the UKOT-PHN hub on TGHN.
As I was having trouble working out the best way to set up the Shiny App R files, I wrote this to demonstrate to my senior colleague when I asked
for help, what I would like the code to do and how I would like the app to work.
Once he helped me set up the inital basis of the Shiny App, I was able to read the code and implement changes and adjustments.
